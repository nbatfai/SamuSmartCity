# SamuSmartCity - Everybody has been travelling in a car since nobody got a car.
This is a new edition of OOCWC (rObOCar World Championship) called "There is no own car". 
This project is a fork of the Police edition of OOCWC called robocar-emulator, see https://github.com/nbatfai/robocar-emulator 

## Practical Robopsychology: Samu Has Learned the Traffic of the City
This project is an example program of the paper entitled "Practical Robopsychology: Samu Has Learned the Traffic of the City".

### Milestones

First we need to create a test environment where we will be able to tune the interactions between 
Samu's COP-based prediction engine and the traffic simulation. It can be seen in this video: https://youtu.be/97L7ure2nPw
